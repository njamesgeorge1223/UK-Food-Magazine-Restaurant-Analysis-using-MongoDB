# Eat Safe, Love

In this Challenge, I've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.  The data comes from UK Food Standards Agency, which evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating.
